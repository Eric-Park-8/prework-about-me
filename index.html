      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is Eric, and I am looking to start a career in coding. Though my degree is in Psychology, coding has always been something I wanted to learn how to do. Throughout the very tough times recently, I made the decision to learn how to code so I can have a more reliable career as well as to do something that is enjoyable for me.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Los Angeles, California</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy playing video games, working out, watching American Football, and exploring new music.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I want to work within the Esports industry. I believe it's a constantly growing industry which combines both of my passions of video games and competition into a fun and amazing product for all types of audiences.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Lakewood, California</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It's something that's always interested me since I was young and customizing social pages. I have previously been intimidated of learning it since I went to school for something completely different, but have recently decided to make the jump into the field.</p>
